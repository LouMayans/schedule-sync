## New Features

- Workspace apps can now call methods on behalf of users for methods which require the `X-Slack-User` header. When
  calling one of these methods, specify the user ID in the new `on_behalf_of` option. - thanks @aoberoi (#609)
- The new `rejectRateLimitedCalls` option in the `WebClient` constructor allows you to customize how you'd like to handle
  rate limiting. If you set it to `true`, the `WebClient` will not attempt to retry an API call for you, and will instead
  return an error with a `code` property set to the value `ErrorCode.RateLimitedError`. - thanks @aoberoi (#599)
- Automatic pagination for cursor-based pagination enabled methods: It's always recommended to perform
  pagination using the `cursor` and `limit` options directly, but if you don't pass either when calling a method, the
  `WebClient` will automatically iterate through all the pages and returned a merged result. - thanks @aoberoi (#596)
- The `WebClient` will warn when calling deprecated methods (`files.comments.add` and `files.comments.edit`) - thanks @aoberoi (#604)
