## New Features

- The `IncomingWebhook` constructor now has an `agent` option. It works exactly like the `agent` option from
  `WebClient`. It's very useful for setting a proxy for requests using packages like `https-proxy-agent` or `tunnel`.
  Thanks @romanbalayan (#640)

## Documentation improvements

- Fixes the TypeScript `lib` configuration instructions for versions 3.1 and above. Thanks @melisdogan (#650).
